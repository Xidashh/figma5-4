            <p class="boxParagrapConteiner">Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, this
                hostel has a rich history tied to
                mountaineering and the great outdoors. Originally built as a coach inn in the late 1800s, it served
                travelers journeying through the rugged terrain of Snowdonia.
                What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over the decades, it became a base for
                legendary climbers who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging circuit of ridges—and contributed to
                the
                development of modern mountaineering in the UK.</p>

            <p class="secondboxParagrapConteiner">Located in a beautifully preserved Victorian mansion built in 1885,
                the HI Sacramento Hostel offers a glimpse
                into the grandeur of California's past. Originally the home of a wealthy gold prospector, the mansion
                later
                became a boarding house and eventually a hostel. Its elegant architecture, complete with stained glass
                windows, carved wooden staircases, and period furnishings, makes it a unique blend of history and
                hospitality.</p>

            <p class="thirdparagrapConteiner">Once a courthouse in the heart of London, Clink78 Hostel is steeped in history. Built in the 19th
                century,
                the building was where Charles Dickens worked as a court reporter, inspiring elements of his famous
                novel
                Oliver Twist. In the 20th century, it served as a magistrates' court and famously hosted trials for punk
                bands like The Clash. Today, the hostel preserves its legal heritage—guests can stay in refurbished
                prison
                cells and relax in the courtroom-turned-lounge.</p>
